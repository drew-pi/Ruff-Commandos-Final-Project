### Project: Plants Vs. Zombies
- A remade version of Plants Vs. Zombies java flavored
- "Use your arsenal of 49 zombie-zapping plants — Peashooters, Wall-nuts, Cherry bombs and more — to mulchify 26 types of zombies before they break down your door."
- We won't have as many plants or zombies but the concept will remain the same
