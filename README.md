# RuffCommandosFinalProject

### Team RuffCommandos
- Jacob Ng
- Andrew Piatetsky

### Project: Plants Vs. Zombies
- A remade version of Plants Vs. Zombies java flavored
- "Use your arsenal of 49 zombie-zapping plants — Peashooters, Wall-nuts, Cherry bombs and more — to mulchify 26 types of zombies before they break down your door."
- We won't have as many plants or zombies but the concept will remain the same


### v0 information
- Using v0 as proof of concept models for functionality that we will need for our program
- AdvancedButtonTester
  - this is useful because we will implement drag and drop functionality to place plants in certain locations
- ButtonDriver
  - Models how our buttons will work (probably too simple for our purposes)
- HeapTester
  - Testing how a minimum Heap would work with objects in processing (works exactly the same as with those in java)

### How to Launch
- No clue
