Heap using only generic comparables was not too difficult but what was 
hard was making sure that you could only make a Heap of comparables (by 
saying <T extends Comparable<T> > and then in any new class, in this case 
Ball, we had to make it inherit the compareTo method by implementing 
Comparable<Ball>


creating buttons was harder bec of the strange way that fill and 
processing works. fill has to always come before the shape that you 
create, otherwise it fills the next shape created instead
